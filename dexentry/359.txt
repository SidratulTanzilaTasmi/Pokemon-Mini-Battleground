Absol, the Disaster Pokemon.
Absol lives deep into the mountains but every time Absol appears before people, it is followed by a disaster. That's why it's called the Disaster Pokemon. But although it's rumored to cause catastrophies, in reality, this Pokemon sharply senses even subtle changes in the atmosphere to predict natural disasters and appears before people to warn them.
