Pikachu, the Mouse Pokemon. It is the evolved form of Pichu.
It has small electric sacs on both its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while Pikachu sleeps. If threatened, Pikachu looses electric charges from the sacs. This intelligent Pokemon raises its tail to check its surroundings. When multiple Pikachu meet, they'll touch their tails together and exchange electricity through them as a form of greeting. It occasionally uses an electric shock to recharge a fellow Pikachu that is in a weakened state. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning.
