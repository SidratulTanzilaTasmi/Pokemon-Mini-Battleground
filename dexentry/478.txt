Froslass, the Snow Land Pokemon. It is the evolved form of Snorunt.
Legends in snowy regions say that after a woman lost on a snowy mountain met her end, her soul possessed an icicle and her regrets lingered on. From them, this Pokemon was born. Now when it finds humans or Pokemon it likes, it freezes them and takes them to its chilly den, where they become decorations. The food it most relishes is the souls of men.
