Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokemon. It is the evolved form of Wartortle.
It is a brutal Pokemon with pressurized water jets on its shell. Once it takes aim at its enemy, it blasts out water with even more force than a fire hose. It firmly plants its feet on the ground before shooting in order to withstand the recoil.
