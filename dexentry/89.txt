Muk, the Sludge Pokemon. It is the evolved form of Grimer.
It's so stinky! Muk's body is thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison. As it moves, a very strong poison leaks from it, making the ground there barren for three years. The foul fluid that Muk's body seeps gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pokemon's body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid. Touching it accidentally will cause a fever that requires bed rest. Groups of Muk gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse. After recent environmental improvements, their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.
